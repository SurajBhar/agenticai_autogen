    "\n",
    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  A subroutine (function or procedure) is the simplest unit of reusable code. You call it, it runs top to bottom, and when it’s done, control returns to the caller.\n",
    "* **Python example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def greet(name):\n",
    "      return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(greet(\"Suraj\"))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **Key traits:** Linear execution, always starts at the top and exits at the bottom.\n",
    "* **Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clear, simple, reusable.\n",
    "  * Easy to debug.\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Blocking: can’t pause/resume in the middle.\n",
    "  * Limited flexibility for tasks that need interruptions (e.g., waiting for I/O).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Coroutine**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  A coroutine is like a subroutine that can *pause* and *resume*. Instead of just returning once, it can yield control back and pick up later where it left off.\n",
    "* **Python example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def countdown(n):\n",
    "      while n > 0:\n",
    "          yield n\n",
    "          n -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  for num in countdown(3):\n",

    "      await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "      print(\"World\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **Key traits:** Cooperative multitasking; execution pauses at `yield` or `await`.\n",
    "* **Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Good for I/O-bound tasks (networking, file I/O).\n",
    "  * Lightweight compared to threads.\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Requires explicit `await` (programmer responsibility).\n",
    "  * Not truly parallel (only one coroutine runs at a time on a single thread).\n",

    "## **3. Synchronous Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:**\n",

    "  * Simple, predictable.\n",
    "  * Easier debugging.\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **4. Asynchronous Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  Code doesn’t block; tasks can yield control while waiting, so other tasks can run in the meantime.\n",
    "* **Python example with `asyncio`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import asyncio\n",

    "  * Many tasks can progress “at once” without threads.\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",

    "  * Harder mental model.\n",
    "  * Debugging is trickier.\n",

    "* **Definition:**\n",
    "  Structuring a program so multiple tasks *make progress* at the same time. They *may not* literally run simultaneously but are interleaved.\n",
    "* **Python examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **With asyncio (single thread):**\n",
    "    Good for thousands of network connections.\n",
    "  * **With threading:**\n",
    "    Several threads interleave execution.\n",
    "* **Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Great for I/O-bound workloads.\n",
    "  * Improves responsiveness.\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * More complex logic (synchronization issues with threads).\n",
    "  * Threads in Python are limited by the GIL for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

    "## **6. Parallelism**\n",

    "  * Can use all cores.\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * More overhead (processes heavier than threads).\n",
    "  * Data sharing is tricky (need IPC, serialization).\n",
